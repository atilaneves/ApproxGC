# ApproxGC

The Approx system is a cache of Debian deb files that is used as a local proxy for whatever repositories are
configured. This enables a site to keep remote network traffic to a minimum when upgrading more than one
Debian style (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint,â€¦) computer.

This program is to remove "garbage" from the cache where garbage is defined to be anything other than the
latest version of a given package.
